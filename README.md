# MuJoCo-Laboratroy
This repository presents a collection of reinforcement learning experiments conducted in the MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) environment. It explores and evaluates various state-of-the-art algorithms, including REINFORCE, A2C, PPO, DDPG, and SAC, focusing on complex robot control and motion control tasks.
